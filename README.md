# Hello, I'm Mehedi Hasan Shuvo!

### Who am I?

I am a developer who enjoys creating apps and solutions for random challenges.

### What do I do?

I work as a full-stack developer, and in my free time, I enjoy developing solutions for problems that I come across.

### When do I do that?

Whenever I have some free time, I love diving into different projects and playing around with various technologies and frameworks. The thing is, I tend to start a bunch of random stuff but rarely finish them. Still, I find it exciting to learn new things while working on these projects.

### What are your projects?

I mostly work on personal projects that I don't make public. However, the ones I do release are usually at least (almost) complete. 

You can check my repositories [here](https://github.com/duetianmehedishuvo?tab=repositories).

### Want to work together?

If you're interested in working together on a project or just want to chat, please get in touch with me at [duetianmehedishuvo@gmail.com](mailto:duetianmehedishuvo@gmail.com)!
